/**
 * This class manages common facilities for multi-threaded environments, It can register different facilities for each thread, and also a default one, so that
 * they can be referred by static methods, while possibly having different ones for different threads. Also a default facility exists that is used for threads
 * for which no particular facility has been registerd registered.
 *
 * <p>Currently the only kind of facilities managed is MsgLogger.</p>
 *
 * <P>An example use of this class is if 2 instances of a decoder are running in different threads and the messages of the 2 instances should be separated.
 *
 * <P>The default MsgLogger is a StreamMsgLogger that uses System.out as the 'out' stream and System.err as the 'err' stream, and a line width of 78. This can
 * be changed using the registerMsgLogger() method.
